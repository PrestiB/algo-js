--- Comparison operators ---

===: returns true if both operands have exactly the same value. Else it returns false.
!=: returns true if both operands don't have the same value.
>: returns true if the first operand is strictly greater than the second one.
<: returns true if the first operand is strictly lower than the second one.
>=: returns true if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second one.
<=: returns true if the first operand is lower than or equal to the second one.

--- Logic operators ---

&&: returns true if both operands are true.
||: returns true if any of the operands are true.
!: only takes one operand. Inverse the value of its operand. If it was true it becomes false. If it was false it becomes true.

--- Combine operators ---

(a > 2) && (b < 4): returns true only if a is greater than 2 and b is lower than 4.
(x >= y) || (y === z): returns true only if x is greater than or equal to y or y is equal to z.
!(a < 2): returns true only if a is not lower than 2. This is the same thing than writing a >= 2.
(!(a < b) && (x > z)) || !(i === j): huu... try to guess ! */
